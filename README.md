# ProjectEuler.net

As I work through my problems on ProjectEuler.Net, I'll be saving my solution code to a repository here on GitHub. However, in favor of fairness, and to maintain the rules of the project, I'll be placing them in a private repository. In order to track my progress (and maintain public GitHub viewings) I'll be uploading the dates I begin and complete each challenge. If you have any additional questions, or wish to view this repository, please feel free to contact me.
